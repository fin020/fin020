## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Finley. 
I am an economics student in my penultimate year at the University of Leeds and I'm currently learning Python and R for applications in quantiative finance. My general interests outside of academia are chess, playing the piano, and fitness. 

Please see my Finance repository for my personal projects.
